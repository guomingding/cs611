Tic Tac Toe

- Can scale from 3x3 to nxn board (6x6 order and chaos)
- game play from terminal, no GUI
- code should be scalable and extendable
- position that already been picked or not on the range of the board should
    not be invalid
- Condition to determine game finish (three in a line, or all the 
    position are picked)


Scalability is not limited to the state of play. Scalability can also imply 
    learning and intelligence.  What if (at some point in the future) you 
    wanted to make a smart game that learned from each round. 
    Specifically, given the size of the board, which is the best starting 
    point, or which is the most popular starting point, etc. 
    This would require information to be maintained by each round, 
    the board, and even each cell of the board. This is not an expectation 
    of the current submission, but the ability to allow for this type of 
    scalability is not unreasonable and your design will be evaluated 
    accordingly.

To check for extendability, consider if your class design would be easily 
    extendible to other turn based games like sorry, monopoly or card games, 
    or other cell based board games like connect four, wordle, or chess, etc.



I need a class Board to creat board for any specific number of column in one row
    one for board function, keep track with all the data
